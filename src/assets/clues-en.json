            "We leave a mill-rich town and travel towards a capital in the east. The journey goes through blue and yellow land in a double sense, but linking our city with a western d-variant is completely wrong.",

            "In our divided city, culture flows, and the city's red mill and a certain Amelie became a film in 2001. Famous Hugo and our lady became a classic; does it ring a bell?",
            "Two by two we skate on mirror-like water where the first peace was signed. In 1889, an exhibition celebrated and seen by the whole world. A fortress was stormed, heads rolled, the history was bloody, but today people smile in our city.",

            "Vasa, Linné, and Hammarsköld all ended their journeys here. A silver-covered sacred scripture can be found in the central room of the town on a feminine rediviva.",
            "A cat without a tail and also a certain cream nose reside in our university city, where the oldest in the Nordic countries is located. The attentive observer perceives the task of us ending in a large room as something evident.",
            "We are heading toward the city of the Dog Star, where an annual final is played on the scholars' ice-covered arena. If you look around, you’ll discover a large Cathedral and the sports complex Fyrishov here.",

            "We continue this shaky journey at very high speed, passing Sodium-ara and the Just-In-Time empire. Being big here has been a hit, as even the monster from the sea has experienced.",
            "Despite a high standard of living and a good economy, the country is not flawless, says Nikkei. 1968 was a great canoeing year for the blue and yellow; I wonder what 2020 will bring—not many sumo golds, but there will at least be medals.",
            "Kurosawa made many films in this island nation, manga are drawn and often turned into Western copies. An advanced handball number and a classic sports commentary lead you to the country whose capital we are soon arriving at.",
