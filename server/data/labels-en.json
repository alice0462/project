You will hear a number of clues worth 10 points, 8 points, 6 points, 4 points, and 2 points. In the top right corner, youâ€™ll see a timer, and you must answer within the given time. When you think you know the destination, pull the emergency brake and submit your answer! When the destination is revealed, you will need to answer two questions related to it. A correct answer to one question gives 1 point, and correct answers to both questions give 3 points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!",
